# nuxt-base-static
**NUTX implementation example for STATIC / NO SSR WEB APP**

This directory contains your static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).

### install dependencies
$ npm install

###  serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

### build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

###  generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
